# Problems to solve:

1- seg fault in ft_memset()

2- start angle must be pi /2

3- movment still need fix

// Done:4- seg fault if the player hit the upper edge
	(it will be fixed automatically when doing the walls)


if I put one of the info down off the map, it gives seg fault


To do:
Done:
in the struct player we must fill the variable start_angle from the map
S ===>game->player.start_angle = pi / 2;
N ===>game->player.start_angle =  (3 * pi / 2);
W ===>game->player.start_angle = pi;
E ===>game->player.start_angle = 0;
